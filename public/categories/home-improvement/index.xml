      <description>As I mentioned in my previous blog post on Part One - How to stop paying for your landline, most people pay between $100 and $250 each month to their cable providers. They are paying for Internet, Phone, and TV. My last post showed how you can save at least $20 per month by not paying your cable company for a phone line. Now for the bigger savings. Lets save some money by watching TV for free without cable.</description>

      <description>Many homes are still subscribed to cable. Many are still paying for bundled services like Phone, Internet, and TV. Often, these nasty cable bills are around $200 per month.
Now, what if I told you you didnt need to pay for phone or TV. You can get internet service in most places for between $30 - $100 depending on how fast broadband speeds you want. I currently pay AT&amp;amp;T for their Gigabit Fiber network $70/month.</description>
