If you have a website that you want to drive insane amounts of traffic to, it is critical that one of the first steps you do is set up a Pinterest Business Account.

First, if you are new to Pinterest, then the first lesson is to realize that Pinterest is a search engine.  It's not a social website (like Twitter or Facebook).  It's not just an idea's tool to save your bookmarks.  It's about sharing images (pins) to your website, targeting various applicable keywords that are relevant to your posts.  In other words, a search engine!!!

Great, now that we have cleared that up, there are two types of accounts on Pinterest.  Individual Accounts, and Business Accounts.

The main difference between the two types of accounts is that Business Accounts are designed for brands, and gives you a bunch of extra tools like **Pinterest Analytics**, and **Pinterest Ad Tools** that are _extremely valuable_.

If you have a website which you are trying to grow, and build your brand, then it's critical you create a business account now.  If you already have followers and a bunch of pins on your individual account, then you can also upgrade that account to a business account.

Creating a business account is free, and super simple.

I always like to start by directing users to official documentation.  In this case - here is the official Pinterest guide to [get a business account](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/get-a-business-account "Get a business account").
