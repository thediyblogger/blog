## Why should I claim my website on Pinterest?

Claiming your website on Pinterest is a very important step on your way to driving crazy traffic to your website.  You need to have a claimed (and verified) website before you can apply for Rich Pins on your site.  You need a claimed website to also gain invaluable analytics from Pinterest about how pins are doing sending traffic to your website.

Claiming your website also signals to Pinterest that you are a legitimate business, and that Pinterest should start distributing your content to other Pinners.  

You website address is displayed prominently on your Pinterest profile, and your pins will be displayed with your business name and logo.
