Hi

This is my first traffic report for  [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies").  I have read many other posts by other bloggers about their Income reports and Traffic reports.  Most of these reports show how successful they have become.  What is usually missing is the reports from the start of their journey.  Answers to questions like

> How long did it take for you to see traffic and start making six figures from blogging?

So reading my first traffic report, it's not going to be a success story (yet!).  I am working on it.  But this is the start of my journey with this blog.  And I want you to be part of my journey as we grow our blogs together.

I feel that many bloggers who post income reports only do so once they are successful, and make it sound like they earned $100k after just one month of blogging.  The reality is they probably spent a year or so building their audience, and some had failed blog attempts before that, before they became successful.  I want to show you some of the pain that goes into blogging to become successful (fingers cross that I do) in real time, so you can see the work that goes into it.  Maybe along the way you will see some of the strategies I deploy and the impact of those changes.

First, some background about me.

I am from the software industry and have worked in IT for 20 years.  I have had previous roles where I worked on SEO and it became a passion of mine.  I love building things, as well as mentoring others to be successful in their roles.

In January 2019, I made a few resolutions:

1. Lose 30 pounds.
2. Start my own business.
3. Leave my full time employment.

It is now June 2019, and here is my progress report on each goal:

#### Lose 30 pounds <span class="fa fa-check" ></span> 
 I am down 25 pounds (after just 5 months).  I did this following the Keto diet which has not only made me physically leaner, but I feel I think more clearly and given me more energy to focus on my blogs.

#### Start my own business <span class="fa fa-check" ></span> 
I started two online businesses - [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies") with a software offering - <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a>.

#### Leave my full time employment <span class="fa fa-check" ></span> 
I left my job of 8 years, and currently am not in full time employment. But that may have to change in the next few months, once my online businesses are mostly on Autopilot but not generating enough revenue to replace a full time income.

So, let's go into the second goal here - the online businesses, and how they are doing.

## Online Business 1: DrawBuildPlay

This was my first blog where I wanted to apply the knowledge I had about SEO and the new Pinterest strategies I was learning about.  I have a passion for Home Decor DIY, so I launched my blog in February 2019, and started creating content about the many home renovation projects I have done.  In mid March I started applying the Pinterest strategies I now share on this blog and I started to experience some phenomenal growth in traffic.

### Retrospective

The Page Views (which is the only metric that really counts at the end of the day) continues to grow at a rate of 60% - 70% month over month.

During June, I also took a step back from focusing on DrawBuildPlay to focus on sharing my techniques and strategies through The DIY Blogger.  So I expect June to grow, but not at that same rate.  I need to keep up with my pin strategies for DrawBuildPlay and regularly post my popular pins to Tailwind Tribes (at least 2 per day), and continue to reshare other content to grow my reach and following, which in turn will increase my Page Views.

I am contemplating turning off Adsense because the frankly the ~ $20/mo income isnt a significant amount, and the ads take away from the user experience.

### Goals for July

1. Join 1 or 2 group boards that have better engagement.
2. Pin less (10 times per day, 30% my content), with higher quality content that get repins to boost my engagement scores.
3. Fix the poor quality descriptions I have on some of my older pins.
4. Create fresh content (either more pin images for existing posts, or publish new posts)

## Online Business 2: The DIY Blogger

At the start of June, I officially launched The DIY Blogger and started focusing on my Pinterest and SEO strategies for it.  Although the Pinterest profile was up a few months before that, I started the month with a reach of 35 people only, and 0 daily page views.  Basically no one cared.

I completed my initial implementation of <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> - which automates the auditing of your Pinterest account on a regular basis and makes recommendations based on proven Pinterest strategies.  I can't wait to open this up to you all to use.  For now, it's limited to a few early access customers only.  In fact, I drink my own champagne and use <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> to guide to strategies for growing traffic to The DIY Blogger.  How awesome is that!

So, the first step was to enable Rich Pins on my account.  Unfortunately, Pinterest seems to have a glitch currently where they say rich pins are enabled but the rich data doesn't actually get populated.  I have an open ticket with Pinterest, but no doubt this is currently impacting my ability to gain a targeted audience quicker as not having rich pins affects your SEO.

{{<imgproc "/uploads/pinkarma-june2019.png" Resize "600x" >}}Pin Karma recommendations for June 2019{{</imgproc>}}

I have optimized my profile and boards based on my targeted keywords and got each board up to at least 20 pins so that they can start ranking better on Pinterest.

I am also reducing the amount of daily pins I submit (both manual pinning and scheduling through Tailwind) so that I pin more engaging content or my own content so I have a better repin ratio for my pins.  I want Pinterest to see me as an engaged and active contributor to the platform.

Finally, I am also generating lots of new content through interesting and compelling blog posts.  These posts are based on some of the basics to go along with the <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> strategy guides, but also based on lessons I am applying along my own journey.  Each new blog post is new content for Pinterest, which helps build my reach.

Currently, each pin averages 1 - 2 images that are pinned to multiple boards.  I am working to increase this to at least 5 pin images per blog post, which will then be posted to each of my boards over an interval (usually 1 week apart for each image, with the same image going to another board once every 5 weeks).

By the end of my first month engaging Pinterest for TheDIYBlogger, my stats are:

### Retrospective

June was all about launching The DIY Blogger and getting the basics in place for growing traffic with Pinterest.

I have not started selling <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> subscriptions, or my Pinterest Perfection course yet, so my income on The DIY Blogger currently is $0.  Once traffic to my blog increases and I have an engaged audience, I will open up <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> to that audience - which could generate a good passive income by providing significant value to my audience.

Towards the end of June I modified my home page to help generate subscribers (using the <a href="https://www.leadpages.net/blog/guest-post-home-page-design-bryan-harris-videofruit/">upside-down home page</a> concept by Bryan Harris).  I have also been publishing new content regularly, which I hope will start ranking and delivering traffic.

### Goals for July

1. Pin less (10 times per day, at least 30% my content), with higher quality content that get repins to boost my engagement scores.
2. Continue creating new content.
3. Create at least 5 pin images for all existing posts and schedule them to publish.
4. Build my subscriber list.
