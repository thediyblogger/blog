Hi

This is my first traffic report for  [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies").  I've read many other bloggers post about their Income reports and Traffic reports.  Most of these reports show how successful they have become.  What is usually missing is the reports from the start of their journey.  Answers to questions like 

> How long did it take for you to see traffic and start making six figures from blogging?

So reading my first traffic report, it's not going to be a success story (yet!).  I am working on it.  But this is the start of my journey with this blog.  And I want you to be part of my journey as we grow our blogs together.

First some background about me.

I am from the software industry and have worked in IT for 20 years.  I have had previous roles where I worked on SEO and it became a passion of mine.  I love building websites and sharing my knowledge with others.  

In January 2019, I made a few resolutions:

1. Lose 30 pounds.
2. Start my own business.
3. Leave my full time employment.

It is now June 2019, and here is my progress report on each goal:

1. I am down 25 pounds (after just 5 months).  I did this following the Keto diet which has not only made me physically leaner, but I feel I think more clearly and given me more energy to focus on my blogs.
2. I started two blogs - [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies").
3. I left my job of 8 years, and currently am not in full time employment - but that may change in the next few months once my blogs are mostly on Autopilot but not enough to replace a full time income.

So, let's go into the second goal here - the blogs, and how they are doing.

## DrawBuildPlay

This was my first blog where I wanted to apply the knowledge I had about SEO and the new Pinterest strategies I was learning about.  I have a passion for Home Decor DIY, so I launched my blog in February 2019, and started creating content about the many home renovation projects I have done.  In mid March I started applying the Pinterest strategies I talk about frequently on this blog and I started to experience some phenomenal growth in traffic.

These are the current stats for the DrawBuildPlay blog:

### **Month End: JUNE 2019 - DRAWBUILDPLAY**

#### PINTEREST STATS

Impressions: 153,274  
Engagement: 7,114  
Followers: 123

#### GOOGLE ANALYTICS

Sessions: 1,235  
Page Views: 3,005

#### INCOME

Adsense: $6  
Amazon Affiliate: $0 (I deactivated my account due to traffic not being high enough yet)

The Page Views (which is the only metric that really counts at the end of the day) continues to grow at a rate of 60% - 70% month over month.

During June, I also took a step back from focusing on DrawBuildPlay to focus on sharing my techniques and strategies through The DIY Blogger.  So I expect June to grow, but not at that same rate.

I am planning on also turning off Adsense because the frankly the $6/mo income is worthless and the ads take away from the user experience.

## The DIY Blogger

At the start of June, I officially launched The DIY Blogger and started focusing on my Pinterest and SEO strategies for it.  Although the Pinterest profile was up a few months before that, I started the month with a reach of 35 people only, and 0 daily page views.  Basically no one cared.

I completed my initial implementation of Pin Karma - which automates the auditing of your Pinterest account on a regular basis and makes recommendations based on proven Pinterest strategies.  I can't wait to open this up to you all to use.  For now, it's limited to a few early access customers only.  In fact, I drink my own champagne and use Pin Karma to guide to strategies for growing traffic to The DIY Blogger.  How awesome is that!

So, the first step was to enable Rich Pins on my account.  Unfortunately, Pinterest seems to have a glitch currently where they say rich pins are enabled but the rich data doesn't actually get populated.  I have an open ticket with Pinterest, but no doubt this is currently impacting my ability to gain a targeted audience quicker as not having rich pins affects your SEO.

I have optimized my profile and boards based on my targeted keywords.  I am currently in the process of populating each of my boards with high quality content, trying to get each board up to at least 20 pins so that they can start ranking better on Pinterest.

I am also increasing the amount of daily pins I submit (both manual pinning and scheduling through Tailwind) so that Pinterest see's me as an engaged and active contributor to the platform.

Finally, I am also generating lots of new content through interesting and compelling blog posts.  These posts are based on some of the basics to go along with the Pin Karma strategy guides, but also based on lessons I am applying along my own journey.  Each new blog post is new content for Pinterest, which helps build my reach.

Currently, each pin averages 1 - 2 images that are pinned to multiple boards.  I will be aiming to increase this to at least 5 pin images per blog post, which will then be posted to each of my boards over an interval (usually 6 days apart).

By the end of my first month engaging Pinterest for TheDIYBlogger, my stats are:

### **Month End: JUNE 2019 - THE DIY BLOGGER**

#### PINTEREST STATS

Impressions: 5,108  
Engagement: 205  
Followers: 62

#### GOOGLE ANALYTICS

Sessions: 22  
Page Views: 96

#### INCOME

Pin Karma: $0

I have not started selling Pin Karma subscriptions, or the course yet, so my income on The DIY Blogger currently is $0.  Once traffic to my blog increases and I open up Pin Karma I hope this generates a good passive income for me.
