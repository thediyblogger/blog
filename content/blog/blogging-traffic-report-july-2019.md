Hi

Welcome to my August traffic report for  [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies").

I have read many posts by other bloggers about their Income reports and Traffic reports.  Most of these reports show how successful they have become.  What is usually missing is the reports from the start of their journey.  Answers to questions like

> How long did it take for you to see traffic and start making six figures from blogging?

So to continue building on my previous traffic reports, we are still not quite a success story yet.  But August was an excellent month for traffic, with trends accelerating for my DrawBuildPlay blog, getting me closer than I expected to my first goal milestone - 100k page views/month.

I feel that many bloggers who post income reports only do so once they are successful, and make it sound like they earned six figures after just one month of blogging.  The reality is they probably spent a year or so building their audience, and some had failed blog attempts before that, before they became successful.  I want to show you some of the pain that goes into blogging to become successful (fingers cross that I do) in real time, so you can see the work that goes into it.  Maybe along the way you will see some of the strategies I deploy and the impact of those changes.

## Online Business 1: DrawBuildPlay

I have a passion for Home Decor DIY, so I launched this blog in February 2019, and started creating content about the many home renovation projects I have done.  In mid March I started applying the Pinterest strategies I now share on this blog and I started to experience some phenomenal growth in traffic.

Here are my current trends for the DrawBuildPlay blog:

### Retrospective

The Page Views (which is the only metric that really counts at the end of the day) grew 110% in July (slightly more than double what I did in June).

As you recall from my last retrospective, towards the middle of June I revamped the Pinterest [Board SEO](/blog/how-to-create-keyword-rich-pinterest-board-names-to-get-more-repins/ "Board SEO") for many of my boards which had started to result in increased traffic to my website.  On July 14, I applied similar SEO techniques by creating new pins with better SEO targeting of the pin descriptions at higher searched terms.  Between the board optimizations from mid May, and the pin optimizations in mid June, it has resulted in a significant boost in page views as well as Pinterest impressions.

### Goals from last month

1. ~~Join 1 or 2 group boards that have better engagement.~~
2. ~~Pin less (10 times per day, more of my content), with higher quality content that get repins to boost my engagement scores.~~
3. ~~Fix the poor quality descriptions I have on some of my older pins.~~
4. ~~Create fresh content (either more pin images for existing posts, and try to publish some new posts)~~
5. ~~Boost the pages/session metric which is currently averaging about 2.4 pages/session, by displaying related posts to the reader.~~

I accomplished the goals I had set last month in my [June Traffic Report](/blog/blogging-traffic-report-june-2019/ "June Traffic Report").  I joined some more group boards, only pin my own content now with better SEO targeting.  I decided not to go back and redo my older pins, since its better to just focus on the newer ones aimed at the right audience.

I attempted to boost the pages/session metric, but ended the month averaging 2.46 pages/session (up from 2.38 pages/session in June).  So it was a slight increase only. I may revisit this one in the future again.

### New Goals for August

1. Create new pins with SEO targeted at high volume searches for remaining blog posts.
2. Create free course (via Teachable) to start collecting email signups.

I have just the one goal for August so I can see how much I can continue to ramp up my traffic.  If I find time, I also will create a free opt in course so I can start to build up my subscriber base.

Once I get to around 100k page views per month, I plan to shift my focus to monetization (through Amazon Affiliates and Paid Courses).

## Online Business 2: The DIY Blogger

Unfortunately I did not spend much time focusing on The DIY Blogger blog during the month of July.  I was on vacation for the first half of the month.  When I returned, most of my focus was on DrawBuildPlay and building out some more tooling (stay tuned).

By the end of my July, my stats are:

### Retrospective

I have not started selling <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> subscriptions, or my Pinterest Perfection course yet, so my income on The DIY Blogger currently is $0.  I am running into challenges launching Pin Karma as I need to go through the new Pinterest Marketing Partners program to access the API based on their new guidelines.  Until PinKarma is approved, I will not be able to officially launch the app.

Once traffic to my blog increases and I have an engaged audience, and receive app approval, I will open up <a href="/pinkarma" alt="Pin Karma - Pinterest Assistant">Pin Karma</a> to that audience - which could generate a good passive income by providing significant value to my audience.

In the meantime, I am hearing from many new bloggers about their struggles to get going on their blogging journey.  I have started building another tool that will simplify the blog creation process and its content management (that doesn't require wordpress/bluehost signups).  Stay tuned for this.

I missed most of my goals for July, and you can see the result of that was a decline in Pinterest views and page views.  I will be carrying over those goals to August.

### Goals for August

1. Pin less, but with higher quality content that get repins to boost my engagement scores.
2. Creating new and exciting content with targeted SEO.
3. Utilize Tailwind to expand my reach.
4. Build up my subscriber list.
