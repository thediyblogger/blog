Hi

Welcome to my August traffic report for  [DrawBuildPlay](https://www.drawbuildplay.com "DrawBuildPlay - Home Decor and DIY Blog") and [TheDIYBlogger](https://www.thediyblogger.com "The DIY Blogger - Pinterest Strategies").

I have read many posts by other bloggers about their Income reports and Traffic reports.  Most of these reports show how successful they have become.  What is usually missing is the reports from the start of their journey.  Answers to questions like

> How long did it take for you to see traffic and start making six figures from blogging?

So to continue building on my previous traffic reports, we are still not quite a success story yet.  But August was an excellent month for traffic, with trends accelerating for my DrawBuildPlay blog, getting me closer than I expected to my first goal milestone - 100k page views/month.

I feel that many bloggers who post income reports only do so once they are successful, and make it sound like they earned six figures after just one month of blogging.  The reality is they probably spent a year or so building their audience, and some had failed blog attempts before that, before they became successful.  I want to show you some of the pain that goes into blogging to become successful (fingers cross that I do) in real time, so you can see the work that goes into it.  Maybe along the way you will see some of the strategies I deploy and the impact of those changes.

## Online Business 1: DrawBuildPlay

I have a passion for Home Decor DIY, so I launched this blog in February 2019, and started creating content about the many home renovation projects I have done.  In mid March I started applying the Pinterest strategies I now share on this blog and I started to experience some phenomenal growth in traffic.

Here are my current trends for the DrawBuildPlay blog:

### Retrospective

The Page Views (which is the only metric that really counts at the end of the day) grew 85% in August.

This increase in page views was a continuation of the trend that started towards the end of July from my [Board SEO](/blog/how-to-create-keyword-rich-pinterest-board-names-to-get-more-repins/ "Board and Pin SEO revamp") for many of my boards which had started to result in increased traffic to my website.

Most of the page increases went to my most popular post.  My second most popular post regarding lawn care started to reduce in views, probably since Spring was over and people were less interested in lawn care.

An interesting thing happened in the second half of August however.  After the excitement of the first half of August where I hit my first 1000 page view day, and came just shy of hitting 1500 page views in a day, my traffic started to decrease again. I'm not 100% positive on what caused this decrease but I have the following theories:

1.  Adding new pin images to take advantage of the increase in traffic caused those pages to load slower (due to adding more large images).  Pinterest decided to penalize my slower site.
2.  My most popular pages are impacted by seasonality (ie lawn care isnt as popular as we approach fall and winter, people are less interested in building a home).
3.  My demographic is impacted by school starting (parents) so they are spending less time on Pinterest.

This month I also hit 10k sessions to my website, and applied for Ezoic Ads.  My request was denied, I suspect due to their platform team not understanding the full potential of Pinterest search.  Thus they felt my traffic sources were unreliable.  Maybe after a few more consistent months I may reapply, or if by that time I qualify for an Adthrive or Mediavine, then I wont bother with Ezoic.  Right now I am happy with Google Adsense as my revenue continues to increase with my traffic.

### Goals from last month

1. ~~Create new pins with SEO targeted at high volume searches for remaining blog posts.~~
2. Create free course (via Teachable) to start collecting email signups.

I accomplished one the goals I had set last month in my [July Traffic Report](/blog/blogging-traffic-report-july-2019/ "July Traffic Report").  I added more pins to my pages, and targeted Fall lawn care.  This helped grow traffic, but may have also had a negative impact.


### New Goals for August

1. Speed up all pages to get back under 5 seconds.
2. Create at least 1 new post.


Once I get to around 100k page views per month, I still plan to shift my focus to monetization (through Amazon Affiliates and Paid eCourses).

## Online Business 2: The DIY Blogger

During August, I revamped my pin karma product as Growva, and officially launched my initial release of it.  

Announcing, Growva.AI. 

[Growva](/dashboard/ "Growva") is your <strong>personal AI-powered virtual assistant</strong> to analyze and monitor your website for you, and help you tailor your content to get real page views and earn more revenue.

Currently, Growva performs SEO website audits and tells you changes need to be made to optimize your pages for search (google and pinterest).  Growva also hooks into your Google Analytics to detect which pages are going viral and suggest ways to boost more traffic out of it.

Growva is currently FREE, as I round out the initial features.  Eventually there will be a paid plan offering more advanced features to help users get insights into their business and have the assistant constantly monitor it, so stay tuned. 

By the end of my August, my stats are:

### Retrospective

I have not started selling <a href="/dashboard" alt="Growva">Growva</a> subscriptions yet, so my income on The DIY Blogger currently is $0. 

I continue to hear from many new bloggers about their struggles to get going on their blogging journey and how much they hate using Wordpress or Bluehost. There really is no reason Wordpress should be charging $25 for a business plan just so you can do basic SEO! I have started building another tool that will simplify the blog creation process and its content management (that doesn't require wordpress/bluehost signups) that I will be offer for a significantly lower price.  Stay tuned for this.

I didn't pay attention to my Pinterest account or publishing new posts in August, and you can see the result of that was a decline in Pinterest impressions.  My page views in August were up, but that was due to some participation I had in some Facebook Groups which drove traffic to my site.

I will be carrying over the following goals to September.

### Goals for September


1. Creating a ton of new and exciting content with targeted SEO.
2. Utilize Tailwind to expand my reach.
3. Build up my subscriber list.

Let me know (below in the comments) how you are doing with the growth of your own websites, and if there have been any amazing tricks you have applied recently that showed a good increase in traffic.
