If you found this page, you probably found it through Pinterest.  If you came here via Google, then awesome.  

I have been building and designing websites for over 15 years.  In that time, most website optimization has been focused on Google and specifically Google SEO.  This is normally fine if your website domain has been around for many years, and has established domain authority, or there are a lot of back links coming back into your website.

On the other hand, if you are just getting started, trying to rank in those #1 spots is almost next to impossible these days with so many websites out there already ranking with domain authority.

This is where Pinterest is a hidden gem.

Most people think of Pinterest as a social media site.  Along the lines of Instagram and Facebook.  But Pinterest is so much more than that.  Its a search engine.

> Pinterest is a Search Engine.

Users of Pinterest find things of interest through visual search.  It is primarily image based, and users will Pin (bookmark) images that are of interest to them.  These are usually pinned to boards, essentially helping categorize the image.

Pinterest users tend to also be slightly more affluent (50% of users have household incomes over $50k, with 10% of households earning over $100k).  This means that these users visiting your site have a higher chance of being interested in buying whatever it is you are selling.

It is also still relatively easy to rank on Pinterest for keywords you are targeting.  This is due to the fact their user base is growing exponentially, and the platform is still much newer compared to google.  Also not all marketers have jumped onto the Pinterest bandwagon yet due to not fully understanding how to utilize the platform.
