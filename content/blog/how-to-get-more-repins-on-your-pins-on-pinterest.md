* Good SEO so your pins appear in Pinterest search
* Interesting images, creating curiosity, with interesting content so that your followers will want to repin it.
* Measure engagement levels of your boards
  * if low engagement, pins on the board wont be broadcast as much to non followers
* Pin more strategically
  * if you pin too much then you will likely have less repins overall, impacting your board engagement levels.
* Use Tailwind Tribes
  * Get your fresh pins in front of your tribes so they can share it to their audiences to repin, improving engagement for these posts.
* Get high quality followers
  * Pin relevant content that your followers are interested in.
  * Don't confuse followers with other random stuff.
  * Don't "buy" followers just for the numbers.
* When pinning other peoples content
  * Only pin content that is already going viral (lots of repins)
  * Make sure they are high quality pins (image, seo, hashtags, links to a relevant page)
* Pin more of your own content
  * New blog posts are considered fresh by Pinterest (which they love) and thus will be broadcast more (increasing chances of repins)
  * You have less control over the content of other peoples pins and you can't see their stats.

Virality = Number of Repins per Pin.  The higher the number the more viral the pin is considered.

Board Virality = Total number of repins on board / Number of pins on board.  The higher the number, the more engagement the board has.
