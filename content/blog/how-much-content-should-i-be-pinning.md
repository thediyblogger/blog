## Establish your Pinterest presence

When starting out with blogging and marketing your blog on Pinterest, the goal should be to fill your boards with relevant and engaging content to help build an audience.

If you just started your blog, chances are you haven't published a whole lot of content yet.  So the balance of what you pin will lean more to other peoples content, while you build out and share yours.

Let's say you have 20 posts on your blog.  You want to create 5 pin images for each post, giving you 100 pin images total.  Now, let's say you have 10 boards that you want to share these images to.  That means you have 1000 pins you can publish (each image pinned to a board is a unique pin) without duplicating a pin to a board.

Since we are aiming to do at least 10 pins per day, you should aim for the following:

* 3 of your own pins to your boards and to group boards
* 7 of other peoples pin to your boards
* 2 of your pins to Tailwind Tribes
* Each image for a post should be scheduled to your boards with an interval at least 4 weeks apart to avoid spamming your users with the same pin.  In other words, don't publish all images for an article within the same week.  Prioritize your schedule to publish to your most important boards first that the content relates to best.

Under this approach, it will take you 50 weeks to have each of your pins circulated to each board without duplicating, and you will be pinning 30% of your own content.

Since you are starting out, you will also want to be filling out your boards with relevant and highly engaging content.  So to help fill up your boards faster, you may want to pin more of other peoples content for that purpose.  Just remember to choose pins that already have shown high engagement so you can piggy back of already successful pins.

The long term goal is to be pinning much more of your own content though.

## Create more content

Your focus initially should be on generating lots of highly engaging and useful content that your readers will love and want to repin.  Starting out with 20 posts gets you in the door, but to grow your reach with good engagement, you need to be creating new and interesting content consistently.  Try to publish a new blog post every couple of days, getting your blog count up to 50 posts fairly quickly.

With 50 posts, with 5 pin images per post, and 10 boards to publish on, we now have 2500 unique pins that we can publish.

Once you have 50 posts, and we still aim to pin at least 10 pins per day, aim for the following:

* 5 of your own pins to your boards and group boards
* 5 of other peoples pins to your boards
* 3 of your pins to Tailwind Tribes
* Each image for a post should be scheduled to your boards with an interval at least 4 weeks apart to avoid spamming your users with the same pin.

With this approach, it will take around 16 months to have each pin circulated at least once to each of your boards, at a rate of 50% of your own content.

Remember, Pinterest is a search engine.  So it will take a while for your pins to heat up and generate lots of long term traffic.  And by pinning slowly and strategically, it will help you increase engagement on your boards since your pins will always feel fresh and not repetitive.

## Pin more strategically

So, to be able to pin a majority of your own content, and pin more strategically in general, let's aim to have 100 posts published.  Again, with 5 pin images per post, we now have 500 pin images to play with, giving us 5000 unique pins (assuming 10 boards still).  We also want to be pinning 80% of our own content now.

Again, we are aiming to pin at least 10 pins per day.  Aim for the following each day:

* 8 of your own pins to your boards and to group boards
* 2 of other peoples pins to your boards
* 4 of your pins to Tailwind Tribes
* Each image for a post should be scheduled to your boards with an interval at least 4 weeks apart to avoid spamming your users with the same pin.

Under this approach, it will take you 21 months to have each of your pins circulated to each board without duplicating, and you will be pinning 80% of your own content.

Here we are pinning far less content in general, but that content will likely be far more engaging and will help you extend your reach far more in the long term.  The content that is pinned is mostly to your website, also helping you improve your reach on Pinterest and traffic to your website.
